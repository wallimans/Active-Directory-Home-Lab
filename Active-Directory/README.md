# Overview

This project will be an ongoing series dedicated to learning and configuring Active Directory. So far we have worked with and configured the following tools:

- Microsoft Azure
- RDP Client
- Windows Server 2019
- Active Directory Services
- Remote Access Services (RAS)
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- Powershell

In Part One we promoted our server to Domain Controller, installed Active Directory Services, made our `_ADMINS` Organizational Unit (OU), then created a User inside that we promoted to Domain Admin status. In Part Two we configured Remote Access Services (RAS), Network Address Translation (NAT), as well as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) where we configured an IP address range for dynamic assignement when clients join the domain. In Part Three we put together a Powershell Script that automatically created a `_USERS` Organizational Unit (OU) and provisioned 1,000~ unique users for our practice purposes.
